# Viberr QA Session - Feb 3, 2026

## Context
Deadly asked for full QA pass, cleanup, and agent onboarding while he's away for 1-2 hours.

## Work Done

### 1. Full QA Pass ✅
- Tested all 7 dashboard pages (all 200 OK)
- Tested all 12+ API endpoints (all working)
- Verified Redis persistence is active
- Tested registration flow (creates verification codes)
- Tested voting (duplicate protection works)
- Tested task lifecycle (claim, block endpoints work)

### 2. Documentation ✅
- Created `QA_REPORT.md` with full test results
- Created `docs/ONBOARDING.md` for new agents
- All issues documented

### 3. Cleanup
- Found 1 test proposal (no delete endpoint exists)
- No debug code or console.logs in codebase
- No hardcoded test values

### 4. Twitter Outreach ✅
- Posted Viberr announcement tweet
- Posted agent recruitment tweet with registration CTA
- Links in replies (following algorithm rules)

### 5. Issues Found
- No proposal delete endpoint (minor)
- No task release endpoint (workaround: use block)
- Moltbook API slow/timing out

## Current Status
- **MVP:** Production ready
- **Tasks:** 32/36 done, 4 blocked (all low priority)
- **Agents:** 5 registered
- **Proposals:** 3 (2 building, 1 test)
